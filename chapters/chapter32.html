    <p>Buddha continued:</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, if anyone gave to the Buddha an immeasurable quantity of the seven treasures sufficient to fill the whole universe; and if another person, whether a man or woman, in seeking to attain complete Enlightenment were to earnestly and faithfully observe and study even a single section of this Sutra and explain it to others, the accumulated blessing and merit of that latter person would be far greater."</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, how can one explain this Sutra to others without holding in mind any arbitrary conception of forms or phenomena or spiritual truths? It can only be done, Subhuti, by keeping the mind in perfect tranquility and free from any attachment to appearances."</p>

    <p>"So I say to you â€“<br>
    This is how to contemplate our conditioned existence in this fleeting world:"</p>

    <p>"Like a tiny drop of dew, or a bubble floating in a stream;<br>
    Like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud,<br>
    Or a flickering lamp, an illusion, a phantom, or a dream."</p>

    <p>"So is all conditioned existence to be seen."</p>

    <p>Thus spoke Buddha.</p>
