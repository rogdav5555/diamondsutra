    <p>The Buddha continued:</p>

    <p>"What do you think Subhuti? If a follower were to give away enough treasures to fill 3,000 universes, would a great blessing and merit incur to him or her?"</p>

    <p>Subhuti replied, "Honored one, such a follower would acquire considerable blessings and merit."</p>

    <p>The lord Buddha said:</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, if such a blessing had any substantiality, if it were anything other than a figure of speech, the Most Honored One would not have used the words 'blessings and merit'."</p>
