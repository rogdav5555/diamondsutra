    <p>"Furthermore, Subhuti, in the practice of compassion and charity a disciple should be detached. That is to say, he should practice compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, without regard to sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind. Subhuti, this is how the disciple should practice compassion and charity. Why? Because practicing compassion and charity without attachment is the way to reaching the Highest Perfect Wisdom, it is the way to becoming a living Buddha."</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, do you think that you can measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens?"</p>

    <p>"No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens."</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, can space in all the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens, both above and below, be measured?"</p>

    <p>"No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all the space in the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens."</p>

    <p>"Well, Subhuti, the same is true of the merit of the disciple who practices compassion and charity without any attachment to appearances, without cherishing any idea of form. It is impossible to measure the merit they will accrue. Subhuti, my disciples should let their minds absorb and dwell in the teachings I have just given."</p>
