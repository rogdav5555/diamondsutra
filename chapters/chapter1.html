    <p>This is what I heard.</p>

    <p>At one time the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove, near the city of Sravasti.</p>

    <p>With him there was a community of 1,250 venerable monks and devoted disciples.</p>

    <p>One day before dawn, the Buddha clothed himself, and along with his disciples took up his alms bowl and entered the city to beg for food door to door, as was his custom.</p>

    <p>After he had returned and eaten, he put away his bowl and cloak, bathed his feet, and then sat with his legs crossed and body upright upon the seat arranged for him.</p>

    <p>He began mindfully fixing his attention in front of himself, while many monks approached the Buddha, and showing great reverence, seated themselves around him.</p>
