    <p>"Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in his perfect physical body?"</p>

    <p>"No, Perfectly Enlightened One, one should not look for Buddha in his perfect physical body. Why? The Buddha has said that the perfect physical body is not the perfect physical body. Therefore it is called the perfect physical body."</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances?"</p>

    <p>"No Most Honored One, one should not look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances. Why? The Buddha has said perfect appearances are not perfect appearances. Therefore they are called perfect appearances."</p>
