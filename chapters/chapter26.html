    <p>Then the Buddha inquired of Subhuti:</p>

    <p>"What do you think Subhuti? Is it possible to recognize the Buddha by the 32 physical marks?"</p>

    <p>Subhuti replied, "Yes, Most Honored One, the Buddha may thus be recognized."</p>

    <p>"Subhuti, if that were true then Chakravartin, the mythological king who also had the 32 marks, would be called a Buddha."</p>

    <p>Then Subhuti, realizing his error, said, "Most Honored One, now I realize that the Buddha cannot be recognized merely by his 32 physical marks of excellence."</p>

    <p>The Buddha then said:</p>

    <p>"Should anyone, looking at an image or likeness of the Buddha, claim to know the Buddha and worship him, that person would be mistaken, not knowing the true Buddha."</p>
